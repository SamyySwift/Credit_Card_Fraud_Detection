# Payment_Card_Fraud_Detection

![](/images/fraud_detection.png)

## **Project Overview**
In this project, I useed a credit card fraud detection dataset, and build a binary classification model that can identify transactions as either fraudulent or valid, based on provided, historical data.
The payment fraud data set (Dal Pozzolo et al. 2015) was downloaded from Kaggle. This has features and labels for thousands of credit card transactions, each of which is labeled as fraudulent or valid. In this notebook, we'd like to train a model based on the features of these transactions so that we can predict risky or fraudulent transactions in the future.
